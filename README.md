## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
1. I think I will use the JS method and test my fetch skills rather than using html heavily which would require loads of pages, I think 5 or 4 pages for each title page.
2. My approach will be to have 4 html pages and use 4 JS pages only. Having 1 JS page seems straightforwward so I want to learn using multiple JS pages also.
3. I first designed the home page using tailwind mobile first
- Problems encountered:
-Getting to display the background I mages. I thought my root was the html page whilst it was the css I output so it kept on giving me 404 till I checked te dev tools and network section.
-The nav underline I tried using after psuedo and failed till I went to group.
-The hover on the home image I tried using box shadow bbut to no avail, so I used a ring instead.
2. Moving on to the other pages
- After designing the main home page I will be using it's skeleton to design the base structures of the other 3 pages and take it from there.
4. Just redid the home page since it was off from the other pages. Though some weird screen sizes do not work but most of them do.
5. After a few days with my display breaking at certain breakpoints.
- Firstly it was the backround image. I had placed it on the main display div and it kept breaking at height about 850px and moved it to the bod tag which resolved the issue
- Then it was breaking at a width and I initially thought it was some strange screen sizes but found out it was breaking at large breakpoint. After a bit of troubleshooting I discovered that it was the nav which was breaking the display. I changed the width of the nav from a percentage value to auto which seems to have fixed the problem.
